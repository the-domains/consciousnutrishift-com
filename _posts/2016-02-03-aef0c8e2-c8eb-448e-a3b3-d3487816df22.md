Welcome and a warm thank you for visiting my website and opening a window onto my life and what I believe. I wish you will gain some good insights from browsing around here that may serve and nourish your personal and spiritual growth..!!

People come into your life for very specific reasons, if you only ask why. Today I thank deeply with love, compassion, understanding, respect and joy every single human being that has crossed my path so far. From my parents, who gave me life, brought me up and thought me incredible life lessons, to my brother, who I shared my adolescence with, from whom I learned to appreciate the incredible life energy behind brotherhood and blood relations. I have to thank the Scouts association, which made me fall in love with Mother Nature and the simple life. I have to thank the guys I spent many years playing volleyball with, which thought me self discipline, commitment and the values around team achievements and the joy in cultivating a healthy body and pushing your limits. I have to thank every single girlfriend of mine, that's right, who helped my transformation from a shy boy to the man of today. I have to thank all my friends, as they showed me that friendship is a wonderful privilege that has to be cherished daily. Infinite appreciation goes to my amazing and beautiful partner, whose determination and love give me strength and fills my heart with love and passion. I have to thank my wonderful daughter, who has been a life master in many occasions and has helped finding my soul and healing my heart. I also have to thank myself for never giving up on me, for constantly showing commitment to revealing my hidden best self, for picking up my wounded body every time I fell in despair and for wanting to achieve greatness and finding ways to get there. 

These all have contributed to create the positive, happy, physically and mentally healthy, emotionally mature, open minded, conscious and aware human being I am today. Today I truly feel blessed for having found the most important thing in my life. I found Me..!!

Finally, I am going to thank all the other beings, those I haven't met yet, who are experiencing life somewhere on this beautiful planet and who are about to bring invaluable teachings into my future life. I will be honoured meeting You.

So, take that step, it may lead you somewhere Magic..!!
